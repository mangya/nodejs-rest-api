A boilerplate for **Node.js** API. This boilerplate gives the minimal structure of application start with while bundling enough useful features so as to remove all those redundant tasks that can derail a project before it even really gets started. This boilerplate users Express with sequelize as ORM and MySQL/PostgreSQL as database.

### Prerequisites

1. ```NodeJs```
2. ```NPM```
3. ```MySQL/PostgreSQL```

### Quick start

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/mangya/nodejs-rest-api.git <your_project_folder_name>`
2. Change directory to your project folder `cd <your_project_folder_name>`
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
4. Create database in MySQL/PostgreSQL.
5. Update the your database name and credentials in the `.env` file.
6. Run the application with `npm start` (MySQL/PostgreSQL service should be up and running).
7. Access `http://localhost:3000` and you're ready to go!

### Project Structure
```sh
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/           # Route controllers (controller layer)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ middlewares/           # Middlewares
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/                # Express database models (data layer)
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”œâ”€â”€ database/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ migrations/            # Database migrations
â”œâ”€â”€ helpers/                   # Utility classes and functions
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                       # API keys, passwords, and other sensitive information
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/                    # Route definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                     # Tests
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js                   # Express application
â””â”€â”€ package.json               # NPM Dependencies and scripts
```
### Creating new models
If you need to add more models to the project just create a new file in `/models/` and use them in the controllers.
```bash
npx sequelize-cli model:generate --underscored --name <modelName> --attributes column1:string,column2:string,column3:string
```

### Running the migrations
```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

### Creating new routes
If you need to add more routes to the project just create a new file in `/routes/` and add it in `/routes/index.js` it will be loaded dynamically.

### Creating new controllers
If you need to add more controllers to the project just create a new file in `/controllers/` and use them in the routes.

## Tests

### Running Test Cases

```bash
npm test
```

You can set custom command for test at `package.json` file inside `scripts` property. You can also change timeout for each assertion with `--timeout` parameter of mocha command.

### Creating new tests

If you need to add more test cases to the project just create a new file in `/tests/` and run the command.
